### 🐛 **Bug Fix: SQLite-Vec Backend Debug Utilities**

This release fixes a critical AttributeError in debug utilities when using the SQLite-Vec storage backend.

#### Fixed
- **Debug Utilities Compatibility** ([#89](https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/issues/89)): Fixed `'SqliteVecMemoryStorage' object has no attribute 'model'` error
  - Added compatibility helper `_get_embedding_model()` to handle different attribute names between storage backends
  - ChromaDB backend uses `storage.model` while SQLite-Vec uses `storage.embedding_model`

#### Technical Details
- **Affected Functions**: 
  - `get_raw_embedding()` - Now works with both backends
  - `check_embedding_model()` - Properly detects model regardless of backend
  - `debug_retrieve_memory()` - Semantic search debugging works for SQLite-Vec users
  
#### Impact
- Users with SQLite-Vec backend can now use all MCP debug operations
- Semantic search and embedding inspection features work correctly
- No breaking changes for ChromaDB backend users

### ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGES**

#### ChromaDB Deprecation
- **DEPRECATED**: ChromaDB backend is now deprecated and will be removed in v6.0.0
- **DEFAULT CHANGE**: SQLite-vec is now the default storage backend (previously ChromaDB)
- **MIGRATION REQUIRED**: Users with existing ChromaDB data should migrate to SQLite-vec
  - Run `python scripts/migrate_to_sqlite_vec.py` to migrate your data
  - Migration is one-way only (ChromaDB → SQLite-vec)
  - Backup your data before migration

#### Why This Change?
- **Network Issues**: ChromaDB requires downloading models from Hugging Face, causing frequent failures
- **Performance**: SQLite-vec is 10x faster at startup (2-3 seconds vs 15-30 seconds)
- **Resource Usage**: SQLite-vec uses 75% less memory than ChromaDB
- **Reliability**: Zero network dependencies means no download failures or connection issues
- **Simplicity**: Single-file database, easier backup and portability

#### Changed
- **Default Backend**: Changed from ChromaDB to SQLite-vec in all configurations
- **Installation**: `install.py` now installs SQLite-vec dependencies by default
- **Documentation**: Updated all guides to recommend SQLite-vec as primary backend
- **Warnings**: Added deprecation warnings when ChromaDB backend is used
- **Migration Prompts**: Server now prompts for migration when ChromaDB data is detected

#### Migration Guide
1. **Backup your data**: `python scripts/create_backup.py`
2. **Run migration**: `python scripts/migrate_to_sqlite_vec.py`
3. **Update configuration**: Set `MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite_vec`
4. **Restart server**: Your memories are now in SQLite-vec format

#### Backward Compatibility
- ChromaDB backend still functions but displays deprecation warnings
- Existing ChromaDB installations continue to work until v6.0.0
- Migration tools provided for smooth transition
- All APIs remain unchanged regardless of backend
