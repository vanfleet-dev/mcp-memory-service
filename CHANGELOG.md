## [3.3.3] - 2025-08-02

### 🔒 **SSL Certificate & MCP Bridge Compatibility**

#### Fixed
- **SSL Certificate Generation**: Now generates certificates with proper Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for multi-hostname/IP compatibility
  - Auto-detects local machine IP address dynamically (no hardcoded IPs)
  - Includes `DNS:memory.local`, `DNS:localhost`, `DNS:*.local` 
  - Includes `IP:127.0.0.1`, `IP:::1` (IPv6), and auto-detected local IP
  - Environment variable support: `MCP_SSL_ADDITIONAL_IPS`, `MCP_SSL_ADDITIONAL_HOSTNAMES`
- **Node.js MCP Bridge Compatibility**: Resolved SSL handshake failures when connecting from Claude Code
  - Added missing MCP protocol methods: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `notifications/initialized`
  - Enhanced error handling with exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts, max 5s delay)
  - Comprehensive request/response logging with unique request IDs
  - Improved HTTPS client configuration with custom SSL agent
  - Reduced timeout from 30s to 10s for faster failure detection
  - Removed conflicting Host headers that caused SSL verification issues

#### Changed
- **Certificate Security**: CN changed from `localhost` to `memory.local` for better hostname matching
- **HTTP Client**: Enhanced connection management with explicit port handling and connection close headers
- **Logging**: Added detailed SSL handshake and request flow debugging

#### Environment Variables
- `MCP_SSL_ADDITIONAL_IPS`: Comma-separated list of additional IP addresses to include in certificate
- `MCP_SSL_ADDITIONAL_HOSTNAMES`: Comma-separated list of additional hostnames to include in certificate

This release resolves SSL connectivity issues that prevented Claude Code from connecting to remote MCP Memory Service instances across different networks and deployment environments.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-29

- **Semantic Clustering**: DBSCAN algorithm for intelligent memory grouping (minimum 5 memories per cluster)
- **Memory Compression**: Statistical summarization with 500-character limits while preserving originals
- **Controlled Forgetting**: Relevance-based memory archival system (threshold 0.1, 90-day access window)
- **Automated Scheduling**: Configurable consolidation schedules (daily 2AM, weekly Sunday 3AM, monthly 1st 4AM)
- **Zero-AI Dependencies**: Operates entirely offline using existing embeddings and mathematical algorithms

#### 🌐 **Multi-Client Server Architecture**
- **HTTPS Server**: Production-ready FastAPI server with auto-generated SSL certificates
- **mDNS Service Discovery**: Zero-configuration automatic service discovery (`MCP Memory._mcp-memory._tcp.local.`)
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Real-time updates with 30s heartbeat intervals for all connected clients
- **Multi-Interface Support**: Service advertisement across all network interfaces (WiFi, Ethernet, Docker, etc.)
- **API Authentication**: Secure API key-based authentication system
- **Cross-Platform Discovery**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with standard mDNS/Bonjour

#### 🚀 **Production Deployment System**

### Enhanced
#### 🔧 **Improved Server Features**
- **Enhanced SSE Implementation**: Restored full Server-Sent Events functionality with connection statistics
- **Network Optimization**: Multi-interface service discovery and connection handling
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with secure defaults
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### 🛠️ **Developer Experience**
- **Debug Tools**: Service debugging and testing utilities
- **Installation Scripts**: One-command installation and configuration
- **Management Scripts**: Easy service lifecycle management
- **Archive Organization**: Clean separation of development and production files

### Configuration
#### 🔧 **New Environment Variables**
- `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_ENABLED`: Enable/disable autonomous consolidation (default: true)
- `MCP_MDNS_ENABLED`: Enable/disable mDNS service discovery (default: true)
- `MCP_MDNS_SERVICE_NAME`: Customizable service name for discovery (default: "MCP Memory")
- `MCP_HTTPS_ENABLED`: Enable HTTPS with auto-generated certificates (default: true)
- `MCP_HTTP_HOST`: Server bind address (default: 0.0.0.0 for multi-client)
- `MCP_HTTP_PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- Consolidation timing controls: `MCP_SCHEDULE_DAILY`, `MCP_SCHEDULE_WEEKLY`, `MCP_SCHEDULE_MONTHLY`

### Breaking Changes
- **Architecture Change**: Single-client MCP protocol → Multi-client HTTPS server architecture
- **Service Discovery**: Manual configuration → Automatic mDNS discovery
- **Deployment Model**: Development script → Production systemd service
- **Access Method**: Direct library import → HTTP API with authentication

### Migration
- **Client Configuration**: Update to use HTTP-MCP bridge with auto-discovery
- **Service Deployment**: Install systemd service for production use
- **Network Setup**: Configure firewall for ports 8000/tcp (HTTPS) and 5353/udp (mDNS)
