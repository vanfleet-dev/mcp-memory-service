## Project Information

### About MCP Memory Service

MCP Memory Service enables persistent, semantic memory for AI applications through the Model Context Protocol. It provides:

- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based memory retrieval using sentence transformers
- **Multiple Storage Backends**: ChromaDB for full features, SQLite-vec for lightweight deployments
- **Multi-Client Support**: Shared memory across multiple applications
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Flexible Deployment**: Local installation, Docker containers, or cloud deployment

### Key Features

- ✅ **Semantic Memory Storage**: Store and retrieve memories using natural language
- ✅ **Multi-Client Access**: Share memories across Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP clients
- ✅ **Flexible Storage**: Choose between ChromaDB (full-featured) or SQLite-vec (lightweight)
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Native support for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux
- ✅ **Docker Ready**: Complete containerization support with multiple deployment options
- ✅ **Hardware Optimized**: Automatic detection and optimization for available hardware (CUDA, MPS, DirectML)
- ✅ **Production Ready**: HTTP/SSE API, authentication, monitoring, and scaling features

### Recent Updates

- **v0.2.2+**: Enhanced multi-client support with automatic MCP application detection
- **SQLite-vec Backend**: Lightweight alternative to ChromaDB for resource-constrained systems
- **Homebrew Integration**: Native support for Homebrew-installed PyTorch on macOS
- **Docker Improvements**: Fixed boot loops, added multiple deployment configurations
- **HTTP/SSE API**: Real-time multi-client communication with Server-Sent Events
